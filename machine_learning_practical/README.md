# LIFE4141_machine_learning_practical

This repository contains the files required for the LIFE4141 machine learning practical.

Clone the repository for the LIFE4141 module into your working directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/BioinformaticsMSc/LIFE4141_2526.git 
```

Navigate inside the directory for this session, inside the cloned repository:

```
cd LIFE4141_2526/LIFE4141_machine_learning_practical
```


Use the yaml file to create your conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate your conda environment:

```
conda activate ml_session
```

Then work through the notebook in Jupyter:

```
jupyter-notebook machine_learning_notebook.ipynb
```
OR
```
jupyter notebook machine_learning_notebook.ipynb
```
depending on your exact system (if one gives you an error, try the other one!)


Once you have finished working through the notebook you can save your output and close the jupyter notebook.
